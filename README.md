# Toggle Click Lock

A simple console application that toggles click lock on your mouse, when executing it, it'll open and close immediately, toggling click lock on or off depending on it's previous state. You need .NET installed to run it.

Made it because I found it annoying having to go through Windows settings, then open up additional mouse settings to toggle it every time.

I used SystemParametersInfo from the Windows API to do the toggling.
